Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should:

Have a deep understanding of layout
Understand jQuery DOM Manipulation
Demonstrate strong ability to navigate through a large block of JSON data
Understand and be able to use Underscore/Lodash templates
Deliverables

Fork the Repo
Create a pull request
Create a gh-pages branch
Normal Mode

Re-Create An Etsy Page - https://www.etsy.com/search?q=whiskey

Utilize the data for whatever search term you use - DATA HERE
You are free to change the search term to whatever you'd like.
We haven't covered how to fetch data using JavaScript, so just copy the data and store it in a variable.
Everything should be styled as closely as possible, including the Header/Sidebar/Links/Search (you can ignore the footer)
You should implement hover events and link the items to their proper Etsy product pages (items only, other links can be just linked to #)
No need to make any of the form elements work, just style them properly
You can ignore the "Top categories for ..." section as that is not in the data. You can also ignore the "Ad" icon.
Pro Tip, worry about the structure first, the JS second and the fine details of the design last

Note: The assets (heart, cart and hamburger icons) are in an assets folder for you.
